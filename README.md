# Install

1. `git clone https://github.com/akump/GroupMeDarkTheme.git`

Optional

   2. Edit line 1 of script.js to include your GroupMe nicknames to highlight your messages in a different color. Note: feel free to hack this code to meet your performance needs. Currently, it will cut off at 1000 messages in the DOM and require a page refresh to work again.

   
```
const yourNicknames = ['Andrew Kump', 'Irelia one trick btw', 'Drevv', 'Brovid-19'];
```

3. `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
4. Click 'Load unpacked'
5. Navigate in file explorer to where you cloned the repo e.g. `D:\git\GroupMeDarkTheme`
