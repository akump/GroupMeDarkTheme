## Potential issues

1. GroupMe breaking changes. I will fix as soon as I can. Some users get updates faster than others or I won't notice a bug because I'm using mobile that day. If something is really broken, make an issue or email kumpandrew@gmail.com
2. Scroll bars on all machines
3. Performance if you leave GroupMe afk for hours. Currently this is negated by just shutting the extension off, but I'd prefer that not to work that way
4. Random screens no one ever goes to - last 10% of CSS
   1. Calendar
   2. Contacts
   3. Archives
   4. Campus Connect
